> **"Automate your infrastructure, not your headaches."**

## ✨ Why Stavily?

Stavily is the **event-driven automation platform** that helps SMBs run enterprise-grade infrastructure with zero manual toil. Think of it as your infrastructure's autopilot — reacting instantly to system events, executing precise workflows, and keeping everything running smoothly.

### 🎯 Perfect for Teams That:
- Run lean technical teams (2-10 people)
- Need enterprise-grade automation without the complexity
- Want to eliminate repetitive infrastructure tasks
- Require GDPR-compliant operations
- Need to scale without scaling headcount

## 💡 How It Works

Stavily uses a simple but powerful pattern: **Detect → Act → Report**

1. **Detect:** Lightweight agents monitor your systems for events (CPU spikes, disk space, service health)
2. **Act:** Pre-defined workflows execute exactly the right response (restart services, clean up space, scale resources)
3. **Report:** Get instant notifications, detailed logs, and compliance-ready audit trails

### 🛠️ Key Features

- **Event-Driven Automation:** React to system events in seconds, not hours
- **Plugin Architecture:** Extend functionality with our growing marketplace of plugins
- **Lightweight Agents:** Run on any system with minimal resource impact (<50MB RAM)
- **GDPR-Ready:** Built-in compliance features for EU businesses
- **Self-Healing:** Proactive issue resolution before they become problems
- **Cost Control:** Automatically optimize resource usage and prevent budget overruns

## 🎯 Real-World Impact
