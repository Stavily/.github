## Main Reason for Stavily?

Running infrastructure shouldn’t feel like an endless cycle of firefighting. Stavily is an **event-driven automation platform** created to keep systems steady, secure, and cost-aware—without relying on engineers to push every button.

Imagine Stavily as your operations co-pilot:

- It integrates seamlessly because every trigger, action, and output is plugin-based  
- It detects issues the instant they arise  
- It resolves the right steps instantly  
- It delivers clear, contextual reports so your team stays informed  
- And anyone—your team or the community—can write plugins to extend it  

No more drowning in tedious tasks. Instead, your team focuses on growth, innovation, and what really moves the needle.

## Stavily vs. Others

Here’s how Stavily stacks up against other automation tools in real-world use cases:

| Tool | Typical Use Focus | Key Limitations | Stavily’s Edge |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Jenkins** | CI/CD pipelines, build/test/deploy automation | Strong in delivery, weak in infra remediation or business workflows | Unifies infra, remediation, and business automation. |
| **Ansible** | Configuration management, orchestration via playbooks | Good for infra, harder for business logic and complex workflows | Event-driven workflows cover infra + APIs. Outbound-only design removes need for SSH and reduces attack surface. |
| **n8n** | Business automation, API integrations, workflow orchestration | Great for APIs, limited infra control | Combines n8n-style integrations with infra actions. |
| **Zapier** | SaaS-to-SaaS automation, no-code workflows | Excellent for SaaS, not built for servers or patching | Works like Zapier for infra: plugins + remediation. |


## Who Benefits From Stavily?

Stavily is especially useful for organizations that:

* Rely on **small but skilled DevOps groups (2–10 engineers)** who need automation with enterprise impact
* Want to eliminate repetitive day-to-day infrastructure chores
* Have to meet **compliance frameworks like GDPR** without adding extra complexity
* Expect their infrastructure to scale without increasing headcount

## The Core Workflow: Detect → Act → Report

1. **Detect**: Agents quietly monitor for key signals—high CPU usage, downtime, disk pressure, and more.
2. **Act**: As soon as an event is detected, workflows step in to apply the right fix, whether that’s restarting a service, freeing resources, or scaling out.
3. **Report**: Every action comes with alerts, detailed logs, and compliance-friendly audit trails so nothing gets overlooked.

## Key Capabilities

* **Event-Driven Automation**: Stay ahead of problems by responding in real time.
* **Extensible Plugin System**: Extend with plugins built in Go, Python, JavaScript, or Rust.
* **Lightweight Agents**: Small footprint, typically under 50MB RAM.
* **Self-Healing Infrastructure**: Problems are solved automatically before customers notice.
* **Intelligent Cost Control**: Keep expenses predictable and prevent waste.

## Practical Use Cases

### Automated Incident Response

```yaml
# Auto-remediation workflow
When CPU > 90%:
  - Analyze processes on afected machines
  - Kill problematic processes
  - Restart services
  - Send detailed report to team
```

### Smart Cost Optimization

```yaml
# Idle resource management
When instances are idle:
  - Identify underutilized servers
  - Scale down automatically
  - Update budget dashboard
  - Notify stakeholders
```

### Security and Compliance at Scale

```yaml
# Nightly patching
Every day at 2 AM:
  - Check patch status
  - Apply missing updates
  - Verify security posture
  - Update compliance dashboard
```

## Business Workflow Automation

### User Offboarding via ServiceNow

```yaml
# Automates IT tasks the moment a ticket is raised:
When ServiceNow ticket = "User Offboarding":
  - Extract username from ticket
  - Call Active Directory API to disable account
  - Remove user from cloud resources
  - Log actions back into the ticket
  - Mark ticket as resolved
```

### Slack-Based Approvals for Scaling

```yaml
# Infrastructure changes can require a human sign-off. Stavily connects directly with collaboration tools:
When resource usage > 80%:
  - Notify team in Slack channel
  - Wait for "/approve scale-up" command
  - If approved, scale out infrastructure
  - Post confirmation message with logs
```

### Jira Ticket Triage and Automation

```yaml
# Save engineering hours by auto-sorting and enriching issues:
When new Jira ticket created:
  - Check component and severity tags
  - Assign to correct team automatically
  - Attach system logs from monitoring
  - Comment with initial diagnostic summary
```

### Finance & Budget Enforcement

```yaml
# Tie infrastructure usage directly to budget policies:
When monthly spend > defined budget:
  - Alert finance team
  - Identify top cost drivers
  - Apply automated scale-down where safe
  - Sync results to finance dashboard
```
