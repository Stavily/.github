## Why Choose Stavily?

Running infrastructure shouldn’t feel like an endless cycle of firefighting. Stavily is an **event-driven automation platform** created to keep systems steady, secure, and cost-aware—without relying on engineers to push every button.

Think of it as a co-pilot for your operations:

* It notices problems the second they appear
* Applies the correct fix immediately
* Shares clear reports so your team is always in the loop

Instead of drowning in repetitive tasks, teams can finally redirect energy toward building, scaling, and innovating.

## Who Benefits From Stavily?

Stavily is especially useful for organizations that:

* Rely on **small but skilled DevOps groups (2–10 engineers)** who need automation with enterprise impact
* Want to eliminate repetitive day-to-day infrastructure chores
* Have to meet **compliance frameworks like GDPR** without adding extra complexity
* Expect their infrastructure to scale without increasing headcount

## The Core Workflow: Detect → Act → Report

1. **Detect**: Agents quietly monitor for key signals—high CPU usage, downtime, disk pressure, and more.
2. **Act**: As soon as an event is detected, workflows step in to apply the right fix, whether that’s restarting a service, freeing resources, or scaling out.
3. **Report**: Every action comes with alerts, detailed logs, and compliance-friendly audit trails so nothing gets overlooked.

## Practical Use Cases

### Automated Incident Response

```yaml
# Auto-remediation workflow
When CPU > 90%:
  - Analyze processes on afected machines
  - Kill problematic processes
  - Restart services
  - Send detailed report to team
```

### Smart Cost Optimization

```yaml
# Idle resource management
When instances are idle:
  - Identify underutilized servers
  - Scale down automatically
  - Update budget dashboard
  - Notify stakeholders
```

### Security and Compliance at Scale

```yaml
# Nightly patching
Every day at 2 AM:
  - Check patch status
  - Apply missing updates
  - Verify security posture

## Business Workflow Automation

### User Offboarding via ServiceNow

```yaml
# Automates IT tasks the moment a ticket is raised:
When ServiceNow ticket = "User Offboarding":
  - Extract username from ticket
  - Call Active Directory API to disable account
  - Remove user from cloud resources
  - Log actions back into the ticket
  - Mark ticket as resolved
```

### Slack-Based Approvals for Scaling

```yaml
# Infrastructure changes can require a human sign-off. Stavily connects directly with collaboration tools:
When resource usage > 80%:
  - Notify team in Slack channel
  - Wait for "/approve scale-up" command
  - If approved, scale out infrastructure
  - Post confirmation message with logs
```

### Jira Ticket Triage and Automation

```yaml
# Save engineering hours by auto-sorting and enriching issues:
When new Jira ticket created:
  - Check component and severity tags
  - Assign to correct team automatically
  - Attach system logs from monitoring
  - Comment with initial diagnostic summary
```

### Finance & Budget Enforcement

```yaml
# Tie infrastructure usage directly to budget policies:
When monthly spend > defined budget:
  - Alert finance team
  - Identify top cost drivers
  - Apply automated scale-down where safe
  - Sync results to finance dashboard
```
