## Who Benefits From Stavily?

Stavily is a great fit for teams that:

* Operate with small but capable groups of **2–10 engineers** who need automation at enterprise scale
* Want to cut out repetitive, low-value infrastructure work
* Must meet **strict compliance and GDPR obligations**
* Need infrastructure that grows without requiring more headcount

## The Core Workflow: Detect → Act → Report

1. **Detect**: Lightweight agents continuously monitor systems for key signals, such as CPU spikes, downtime, or storage limits.
2. **Act**: Pre-configured workflows are triggered instantly, executing the right fix—whether that’s restarting services, scaling resources, or applying patches.
3. **Report**: Teams receive immediate alerts, detailed logs, and compliance-ready audit trails so that nothing slips through the cracks.
